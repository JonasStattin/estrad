Estrad
======

This is a tool to make building modular HTML/CSS/JS websites and apps easier.

It allows you to keep all of a modules code together. To more easily find all the relevant code and to keep the code more structured.

## Install
To install this EstradÂ´s dependencies open a termial window and type:
	
	npm install
	
## Build and start server
To build your project and to start a node server to view it you can simply type:

	gulp
	
[Gulp][0] will build any CSS and JS files and start a server at port `8080`. Gulp will then continuisly listen for file changes and new files to rebuild the scripts.

## Write a module
First you need a page, see `index.html` as an example. It looks like this:

	{{=part.header}}
	{{=part.example}}
	{{=part.footer}}

If you open it in the browser right now that's what it will look like too. `header`, `example` and `footer` are names of modules that the server will look for and interpolate in its place. All modules needs to be placed under a `/modules/` subdirecotry.

The structure of a module looks like this:

	/example/html/example.html
	/example/html/alternative.html
	/example/example.css
	/example/example.js
	
To use the `alternative.html` markup include the module as `{{=part.example.alternative}}`.

Every CSS and JS file under `/modules/` and in the `/css/` respectively `/js/` direcoriess will be concatinated to a `main.js` and `main.css` file.
This behaviour can be changed in the `Gulpfile.js`.

The [JSHint][1] options can, and should, be changed using the `.jshintrc` file.
